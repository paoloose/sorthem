# Sorthem

Sorthem is a language-agnostic tool that enables you to visualize **your**
sorting algorithms with just a few lines of code.

## How does it work?

Sorthem is simple. You have a sorting algorithm, written in **whatever
language you like**. Let's say, a **bubble sort** implementation in **Ruby**:

```ruby
arr = [3, 9, 1, 8, 6, 10, 4, 7, 2, 5]

for i in 0..arr.length - 2 do
    for j in 0..arr.length - i - 2 do
        left = arr[j]
        right = arr[j + 1]

        if left > right
            arr[j], arr[j + 1] = right, left
        end
    end
end
```

Almost all algorithms are made up with [basic operations](#basic-operations)
like comparing two values, swapping them, etc.

Sorthem needs to know two things:

- what are the values you're sorting
- what are the operations you're doing in order to sort those values

An all you need to do is to **print** that information to the standard output.

```ruby
arr = [3, 9, 1, 8, 6, 10, 4, 7, 2, 5]

# Print the array in the format [ 3 9 1 8 6 10 4 7 2 5 ]
puts "[ #{arr.join(' ')} ]"

for i in 0..arr.length - 2 do
    for j in 0..arr.length - i - 2 do
        left = arr[j]
        right = arr[j + 1]

        # Tell Sorthem that you're comparing two values
        puts "compare #{j} #{j + 1}"
        if left > right
            # Tell Sorthem that you're swapping two values
            puts "swap #{j} #{j + 1}"
            arr[j], arr[j + 1] = right, left
        end
    end
end
```

With these three lines of code, you now have a **visualizer** for your
algorithm. You can run it with:

```bash
ruby bubble_sort.rb | sorthem
```

Note that `compare` isn't actually needed. Only `swap` does the job of sorting
the array. `compare` is simply a helpful operation for visualization.

Of course, there are more types of operations for more **complex** algorithms,
each associated with [semantic color](#semantic-colors).

You have a variety of examples in the [examples](./examples/) directory (WIP).

## Basic operations

- **compare**: for comparing to indexes

  usage: `compare i j`

- **swap**: for swapping the values of two indexes

  usage: `swap i j`

- **get**: for consulting the value at some index

  usage: `get i`

- **set**: for setting a value at some index

  usage: `set i value`

  where `0 <= value <= max_value`, otherwise panics

- **context**: makes future index ops relative to this context

  usage: `context start end`

  where `start`and `end` fall within the array's bounds

- **pop**: pops the last context

  usage: `pop`

  panics if there are no contexts to pop

`i` and `j` must be valid zero-based indexes.

## Building sorthem

`sorthem` uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for graphics. The instalation
process depends on your OS. See the [official documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/latest).

```bash
# Debian based distros
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libsfml-dev

# On MacOS
brew install sfml
```

There are no official packages for Windows, but you can download the binaries
from the [official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/).

Run the following commands to build `sorthem`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paoloose/sorthem.git
cd sorthem

# On windows, build under WSL
./build.sh
cat examples/test | dist/sorthem
```
